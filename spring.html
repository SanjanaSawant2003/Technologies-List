    <h2>ABOUT SPRING</h2>
    <p>Spring Boot is an open-source Java framework used for programming standalone, production-grade Spring-based applications with a bundle of libraries that make project startup and management easier.[3] Spring Boot is a convention-over-configuration extension for the Spring Java platform intended to help minimize configuration concerns while creating Spring-based applications.[4][5] The application can still be adjusted for specific needs, but the initial Spring Boot project provides a preconfigured "opinionated view" of the best configuration to use with the Spring platform and selected third-party libraries.[6][7]</p>
